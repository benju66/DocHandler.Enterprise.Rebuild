# Phase 0: Foundation & Planning Investigation Guide
**Duration**: Week 1
**Objective**: Analyze current state and design extensible multi-mode architecture

## Investigation Tasks

### 1. Current State Analysis
**Files to examine**:
- `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs` - Document all SaveQuotesMode functionality
- `Services/SaveQuotesQueueService.cs` - Map queue processing workflow
- `Services/OptimizedFileProcessingService.cs` - Identify file processing patterns
- `Services/OfficeConversionService.cs` - Understand Office automation approach

**Document the following**:
- All user-facing features in Save Quotes Mode
- Complete workflow from file selection to output
- All services and their interactions
- External dependencies (Office, file system, etc.)

### 2. Code Categorization
**Create a matrix of**:
- Shared components (used regardless of mode)
- Mode-specific components (Save Quotes only)
- Components that need refactoring for multi-mode
- Technical debt items blocking mode abstraction

### 3. Mode Architecture Design
**Design and document**:
```csharp
public interface IProcessingMode
{
    string ModeName { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    Task<ProcessingResult> ProcessAsync(ProcessingContext context);
    IModeConfiguration GetConfiguration();
    IModeUI GetUI();
    IModeSecurity GetSecurity();
}
```

**Consider**:
- How modes will be discovered and loaded
- Service isolation between modes
- Shared vs mode-specific resources
- UI composition strategy
- Configuration hierarchy

### 4. Technical Debt Catalog
**Create priority list of**:
- Memory leaks (with specific locations)
- Threading issues (with stack traces)
- Security vulnerabilities (with CWE numbers)
- Architectural problems (with refactoring effort)

## Deliverables
1. **Current State Document** (Markdown)
   - Feature inventory
   - Service dependency graph
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Integration points

2. **Mode Architecture Design** (Markdown + Diagrams)
   - Interface definitions
   - Class hierarchy
   - Sequence diagrams for mode lifecycle
   - Component interaction diagrams

3. **Technical Debt Register** (Spreadsheet/Table)
   - Issue description
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Estimated effort
   - Dependencies
   - Risk assessment

4. **Migration Strategy** (Markdown)
   - Step-by-step plan to extract Save Quotes as first mode
   - Backward compatibility approach
   - Risk mitigation strategies

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT** make any code changes in this phase
- Focus on understanding and documentation
- Identify patterns that can be abstracted
- Look for hidden dependencies and coupling
- Consider future modes when designing interfaces
- Document assumptions about future requirements

## Investigation Questions to Answer
1. What parts of SaveQuotesMode are truly mode-specific?
2. Which services could be shared across all modes?
3. How can we abstract Office operations for different modes?
4. What's the minimum viable mode interface?
5. How do we handle mode-specific configuration?
6. Can modes be combined or chained?
7. What security boundaries do we need between modes?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete feature inventory documented
- [ ] All technical debt cataloged with priorities
- [ ] Mode architecture design reviewed and approved
- [ ] Migration strategy includes rollback plan
- [ ] No breaking changes identified for existing users
- [ ] Clear understanding of 3-month implementation timeline
