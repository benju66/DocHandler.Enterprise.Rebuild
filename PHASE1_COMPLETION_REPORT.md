doc = _wordApp.Documents.Open(inputPath);

// After: Memory safe with automatic cleanup
using (var comScope = new ComResourceScope())
{
    var documents = comScope.Track(_wordApp.Documents, "Documents", "Context");
    var doc = comScope.Track(documents.Open(inputPath), "Document", "Context");
    // Automatic COM object release on dispose
}
```

#### Results
